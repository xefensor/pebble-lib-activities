# Pebble Activities

Main contains the current implementation. [Development](../../CONTRIBUTING.md),
[current maintenance contracts](../../docs/MAINTENANCE.md) and [release policy](../../docs/RELEASING.md)
are the active contributor references. Public downloads and frozen evidence keep
their original versions; a merge to main is not publication.

Repository: [pebble-lib-activities](https://github.com/xefensor/pebble-lib-activities),
part of XOCE — Xef's Open Computing Ecosystem. The package remains
`pebble-activities`; see the [repository migration notes](../../docs/REPOSITORY-MIGRATION.md).

Semantic ongoing activities for **stock PebbleOS**. Published version **0.4.4**
fixes missing activities after source failures, malformed responses and media pause.
Version **0.4.3** reduced timer/subscription churn and fixed delivery lifecycle races.
Version **0.4.2** added a lighter host entry and reduced consumer allocation.
Version **0.4.0** introduced
`activity/summary` schema4: standard summaries with typed headline/detail data,
and media summaries with title/artist/artwork. Plugins publish content; consuming
apps own priority, layouts and animations.

Use `require('pebble-activities/summary')` for new providers and `nativeFormat:3`
for the explicit ACT3 profile. Managed fresh providers persist only publication
counters; snapshot providers preserve native ownership and original leases.
Optional app destinations remain separate from contextual controls.

See the [summary specification](../../docs/SUMMARY-SPECIFICATION.md) for the implemented
API and exact wire fields. Schema1/2/3 and ACT1/ACT2 remain compatible. Dynamic,
Timer and Open Activity have
their own integration/device validation; no Dashboard app is included.

## Publish an activity

```js
var summary = require('pebble-activities/summary');
var provider = summary.defineProvider({
  pluginUuid: OWN_PLUGIN_UUID,
  displayName: 'Delivery',
  storage: localStorage,
  readCurrent: function () {
    // Example content. Read your authoritative current source here.
    return [summary.standard('parcel-42', {
      name: 'Parcel',
      icon: 'delivery',
      headline: summary.text('Driver nearby'),
      detail: summary.text('Front door')
    })];
  }
});
Pebble.registerSourceHandler(provider.handleSource);
```

Use your installed plugin's UUID. Declare the provider's `sourceDeclaration`
in the plugin manifest: category `activity`, item `summary`, with
`summary.SOURCE_PROPERTIES`. The library manages the response metadata; plugins
author the content shown above. Keep one stable ID for the same ongoing item,
and return `[]` when nothing should be shown.

Choose the content that fits your source:

| Content | Publish |
| --- | --- |
| Message or status | `summary.standard(id, {headline: summary.text('Driver nearby')})` |
| Countdown | `summary.standard(id, {headline: summary.countdown({deadline: endUtcSeconds})})` |
| Elapsed time | `summary.standard(id, {headline: summary.elapsed({since: startUtcSeconds})})` |
| Measurement | `summary.standard(id, {headline: summary.value(6.2, 'mmol/L')})` |
| Music or media | `summary.media(id, {title: 'Song', artist: 'Artist', itemId: trackId})` |

Add optional `detail`, `name` or an icon when it contributes useful context.
Media can include `artwork`. A completed/cancelled record is hidden unless its
result is explicitly opted into; acknowledge a finished source by removing it
from the next complete response. Keep timestamps in UTC seconds.

For media, keep `itemId` stable while metadata or artwork arrives for the same
track, and change it for the next track. A host can then animate the track change
once while ordinary updates stay still.

An optional `openApp: {watchAppUuid: APP_UUID}` identifies an already installed
watchapp. It enables hosts such as Dynamic/Open Activity to open that whole app;
it does not select a particular message or timer inside it. Contextual `actions`
are separate capabilities for interactive hosts. Dynamic requests the app
destination and display data only.

The consuming app chooses priority and placement. In Dynamic, Primary uses the
larger bottom-aligned content block and Secondary is one static row above it.
Any source can occupy either role. Text starts at its beginning and truncates;
it never scrolls. Plugins do not choose layouts or primary/secondary positions.

Use `defineProvider` for a fresh authoritative read. A saved native timer or
cached owner snapshot uses `defineSnapshotProvider`; retain its original
observation, revision and validity instead of treating each poll as fresh data.
The [summary specification](../../docs/SUMMARY-SPECIFICATION.md) covers the full API,
manifest, limits and snapshot adapter. The
[older activity API](../../docs/ACTIVITY-SPECIFICATION.md) remains supported for existing
schema3 providers. Real-phone and physical-watch checks retain their separate
scope in [validation](../../docs/VALIDATION.md).

## Version 0.4.4 local candidate

- Retry failed source bindings during configuration and periodic discovery while
  keeping healthy subscriptions. Preserve a pending native reset-clear barrier.
- Recover a still-valid cached summary on a new or recovered binding, including
  on the same source handle. Apply changed source availability independently of
  immutable owner observation, validity and revisions.
- Reject malformed complete responses without installing their partial revision
  floors or terminal history. Isolate malformed declarations from other plugins.
- Invalidate callbacks before unsubscribing so a synchronous late delivery cannot
  re-publish a disabled provider.
- Preserve explicit media `playback:'paused'` as the existing native paused state.
  Playing, buffering, stopped and unknown retain the generic active lifecycle;
  no completion is inferred from playback state.

Provider schemas, exports and ACT1/ACT2/ACT3 formats are unchanged. Existing
ownership, expiry, privacy and notification baseline rules remain in place.
Published as the [0.4.4 development prerelease](https://github.com/xefensor/pebble-lib-activities/releases/tag/v0.4.4).
The heading above retains the original release-notes identifier. The tested
source, SDK package, tarball and tag remain frozen; documentation updates do not
replace their bytes.

## Version 0.4.3 local candidate

- Reuse the existing expiry callback while its absolute deadline stays the same.
- Keep healthy provider subscriptions during settings-only configuration. Disabled
  providers withdraw immediately, including while discovery is waiting. Explicit
  refresh, reconnection and provider removal retain their lifecycle rules.
- Recover bootstrap after disabling/re-enabling before a native session arrives.
- Ignore queued transport callbacks from earlier sessions or disabled/stopped
  consumers. Only a view queued for a specific incarnation-reset barrier can
  acknowledge that barrier.
- Release the retained `view()` snapshot on disconnect, disable and stop, including
  private content and action/navigation descriptors. Hosts must clear any copies
  they separately retained through their own lifecycle handlers.

Public exports, provider schemas, source revision/observation/expiry, native wire
bytes and the legacy Music/phone heartbeat remain compatible. There are no new
services, content caches or polling timers. The deterministic workload reduces
20 unchanged-delivery expiry schedules/cancellations to zero and 20 unchanged
settings resubscriptions to zero; this is work-count evidence, not battery or
phone timing measurement. See [validation](../../docs/VALIDATION.md).

Version 0.4.3 was not released separately. Its changes are included in the
published 0.4.4 development prerelease.

## Version 0.4.2

- Add `require('pebble-activities/host')` for read-only hosts without loading the
  native-owner publisher/storage bridge; the complete root API stays supported.
- Count visible activities and expire snapshots without serializing artwork.
- Remove redundant defensive copies inside the consumer; all public snapshots
  and host callbacks retain their own nested data.
- Index installed provider metadata once per discovery and fingerprint source
  records without copying bitmap arrays or mutable capabilities.
- Preserve every source revision, privacy, validity and native wire check.

Published as the [0.4.2 development prerelease](https://github.com/xefensor/pebble-lib-activities/releases/tag/v0.4.2).
Its tested source and package bytes remain frozen; later documentation updates
do not replace the release archive.

## Version 0.4.1

- Adapt new notifications into the same ACT3 activity roles as other summaries.
- Keep app identity/icon, sender/title, optional private body and app destination separate.
- Preserve baseline suppression, opt-in previews, filters, bounded bursts and coalescing.
- Carry the original notification deadline with optional vibration events.
- Apply shortened source expiry to visible and queued notifications without renewal.
- Keep legacy context defaults, earlier APIs and historical release bytes compatible.

## Version 0.4.0

- Add standard/media semantic source4 helpers and managed response headers.
- Preserve saved Timer revisions, original observations, paused caps and acknowledged removal.
- Add bounded ACT3 metadata for media identity, compact datum selection and semantic symbols.
- Keep optional entity/action/navigation descriptors separately bounded.
- Preserve earlier APIs, published tags and release bytes.

[Earlier releases](https://github.com/xefensor/pebble-lib-activities/releases) retain
their original tags and bytes. Install [Timer](https://github.com/xefensor/pebble-app-timer)
separately to publish native countdowns.

## Version 0.3.0

- Introduce notification-style `activity/live` schema 3: content, optional detail
  and image, with app identity and authoritative source lifecycle metadata.
- Provide text, value, countdown and elapsed helpers without mandatory visible
  labels, meter definitions, field trees or host-specific layout choices.
- Prefer simple sources during discovery and validate their immutable revisions
  before compiling the existing bounded ACT2 packet. Existing session/card
  providers and native packet formats remain supported.
- Adapt native Timer publishing and transient Music through the same model;
  retain original observations, acknowledgement tombstones, privacy and expiry.
- Keep normal/compact composition, provider priority and settings owned by hosts.
  Published 0.2.2 and earlier assets remain unchanged.

## Version 0.2.2

- Expose compatible installed provider identities even while idle, with display
  metadata kept outside authoritative source fingerprints.
- Share a pure provider-order selector. Hosts own their settings and storage;
  the library does not install a settings service or impose a global order.
- Offer an opt-in canonical music card from the existing adapter. Music stays
  transient, uses the SDK source UUID, retains observation and expiry, and clears
  when disconnected or disabled. Polling never renews its source observation.
- Preserve default adapter behavior, ACT1/ACT2 layouts, source revision rules,
  notification privacy and existing provider compatibility.

## Version 0.2.1

- Native publishers may explicitly hide an acknowledged completed result while
  preserving its completed lifecycle and revision tombstone. Visibility changes
  require a newer source revision.
- Providers may request `timerPresentation: 'compact'` for a countdown and one
  identity caption. The detailed Timer projection and generic supporting items
  remain available; configured duration stays in the saved source record.
- Existing schema 1/2 sources, ACT1/ACT2 packets, privacy and expiry rules remain
  compatible. Published 0.2.0 artifacts are preserved.

## Version 0.2.0

- Main and optional supporting text/value/clock, one 40px artwork slot and an
  optional range-derived meter in the same maximum 2,672-byte native frame.
- Independent item clocks, validity and explicit public last-reported retention;
  private content clears and terminal results require bounded source opt-in.
- Immutable authoritative source revisions are separate from native view
  sequences. Older source snapshots and terminal resurrection remain invalid.
- `activity/card` schema 2 and `nativeFormat: 2` are opt-in. Legacy providers,
  consumers, native publishers and stable multi-timer storage remain supported.
- Timer's optional configured-duration metadata produces remaining and elapsed
  clocks without changing native persistence or alarm ownership.

See the [card and native view specification](../../docs/VIEW-SPECIFICATION.md).

## Version 0.1.2

- Publishers may opt into up to eight stable host-owned slots, with independent
  timer runs exposed through the existing multi-instance source convention.
- A new run atomically replaces the prior run in its slot, including after an
  offline restart; unrelated timers are preserved.
- Existing single-record storage migrates to slot zero without changing its
  namespace. Default single-record publisher behavior remains compatible.
- Receipts still require write/readback, a source-wide revision floor and exact
  run/revision/ticket matching. Public source properties and ACT1 are unchanged.

## Version 0.1.1

- Timer now lives in its own [repository](https://github.com/xefensor/pebble-app-timer),
  with its own builds, releases and bundled provider plugin.
- Library packaging and checks no longer require a Timer checkout or PBW.
- The activity protocol and library runtime remain compatible with 0.1.0.
- Historical 0.1.0 artifacts remain available unchanged; app and library versions
  now advance independently.

## Version 0.1.0

- Independent versioned source convention and ACT1 native transport.
- Stock timer publishing, accepted-revision receipts and cold plugin reads.
- Automatic compatible-provider discovery with bounded native projections.
- Countdown and elapsed clocks, expiry and explicit unconfirmed public timer state.
- Optional music/notification compatibility adapter with preserved privacy gates.

## Package contents

| Part | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [Simple activity API](../../docs/ACTIVITY-SPECIFICATION.md) | Content, optional detail/image, app identity and lifecycle through `activity/live` schema 3 |
| Compatibility contracts | Advanced schema 2 and legacy schema 1 remain supported; ACT2 native transport stays internal |
| JavaScript publisher and provider | Accept native snapshots into shared phone-side storage, return revision receipts, and answer plugin reads |
| JavaScript consumer | Discover compatible providers, normalize their state and send a bounded projection through the host's queue |
| Portable C helpers | Validate atomic packets, track sessions and expiry, and calculate countdown or elapsed time |
| Optional compatibility adapter | Existing music/notification coordination, including privacy and notification baselines |

The package does not depend on Watchface Core. The host owns AppMessage dispatch,
SDK services, timers, persistence keys and rendering. Dynamic and another watchapp
can use separate instances of the same helpers while keeping their own UI.

Read-only display hosts can import `pebble-activities/host`. It supplies
`createActivities`, `createContext`, `selection`, `summary`, `summaryView`,
`activity`, `view` and `wire`, without loading `publisher.js`. The root import
continues to include all publisher/provider APIs for existing integrations.

## What the user installs

The library is bundled into each consuming app; it is not a separate watchapp or
background service. A provider plugin may ship alongside its native watchapp, as
[Timer](https://github.com/xefensor/pebble-app-timer) does, or in a plugin-only PBW. The phone app must support
Pebble plugins and have the preview enabled where that is required.

For the timer path, install Timer and a compatible consumer such as
Dynamic. Start a timer on the watch, then return to the watchface. The timer sends
its state through its own PKJS; its plugin later serves the saved snapshot to the
consumer. This is a phone-mediated handoff between otherwise separate apps.

The timer owns its alarm even when sharing fails. Without a phone connection, a
consumer may have no activity or an explicitly unconfirmed earlier countdown.
Reaching zero locally does not prove that the originating app completed or rang.

## Host and native integration

Use `createActivities({..., nativeFormat: 2})` with the host’s existing queue,
clock and SDK lifecycle. Discovery prefers `activity/live`, then the advanced
`activity/card`, then legacy `activity/session`, once per compatible provider.
`catalogue()` supplies validated internal views to host selection; plugins never
choose Dynamic’s priority or layout. Another host can keep its own order and UI.

`activity.toView()` compiles a simple record into the existing ACT2 transport.
The native packet is unchanged. Its mandatory field bookkeeping stays internal;
public activities contain no `main`, `support`, `meter` or layout properties.
The [simple source contract](../../docs/ACTIVITY-SPECIFICATION.md) is the current
plugin authoring guide. [Schema 2 and ACT2](../../docs/VIEW-SPECIFICATION.md) and
[schema 1/ACT1](../../docs/SPECIFICATION.md) remain supported compatibility contracts.
Historical architecture/browser studies describe earlier design decisions and
do not add requirements to the simple API.

For native watchapps, `createPublisher` still accepts authoritative bridge
snapshots, validates revision floors and writes/reads back public shared state
before issuing receipts. `createProvider({presentation: 'simple', appName: 'Timer',
...})` exposes those saved snapshots as `activity/live`; existing session/card
sources remain available. No alarm, native storage or receipt ownership moves
to the consuming watchface.

`createContext` adapts standard Music and notification sources with their
existing privacy/baseline rules. Its transient Music activity now uses the
same simple model, without fabricated Track/Artist labels or a missing-artist
placeholder. Opt into `notificationAsActivity: true` to merge
`context.notificationActivity()` into the same ACT3 roles. It carries app identity,
sender/title, optional private body, app icon and the stock Notifications destination.
The initial phone shade remains a suppressed baseline. All opt-in privacy views
share one non-renewable eight-second arrival window; legacy context defaults keep
their three/eight-second policy. See the [bridge contract](../../docs/VIEW-SPECIFICATION.md#optional-canonical-notification-activity-bridge-041)
for the baseline ACK gate, preferences and expiry-bearing event sidecar.
Native consumers include `pebble-activity-view.h`; these helpers register no SDK
services and allocate no host UI. See the specification for exact failure rules.

### Multiple native timers

A provider that owns several independent records uses
`createPublisher({storage: localStorage, pluginUuid: UUID, maxRecords: 8})`.
Include `ACTIVITY_SLOT` (0–7) in each native snapshot, or `slot` when calling
`accept` directly. The host owns those stable slots; run IDs remain the public
identity. A new run replaces only the previous run in the same slot. Missing
slot means zero, preserving the original single-record path.

Each accepted update advances a **source-wide** revision, even when updating
another slot. A native resync obtains `lastRevision()` and republishes its slots
with distinct higher revisions. The read-only provider loads all slots without
an extra option. A consumer may still project only its best two activities to
the watch; the host chooses that presentation policy.

## Boundaries

- This convention is our public contract, not an official Pebble activity standard.
- Existing timer and workout apps need an explicit integration; discovery cannot
  access another watchapp's private memory or storage.
- The built-in Workout app's live manual session is not exposed by the current
  public SDK. This stock implementation does not claim to provide that session.
- Fully watch-local sharing and Health-style cross-app compositor transitions
  require additional OS support. No firmware or phone-app fork is used here.
- Private music and notification content is transient and is not persisted by
  these consumer helpers. The reference publisher is a bounded, non-private timer
  handoff, not a persistent cache for private messages or medical readings.

## Build and check

Use [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the current SDK/development workflow.
`npm test` runs portable JS/C and workflow guards; `npm run build` writes
`build/candidate/dist.zip` without replacing the frozen root SDK.
`npm run pack:candidate` creates an isolated development npm package.
Release packaging is a separate [explicit milestone](../../docs/RELEASING.md).
